# looking-for-group
Prototype app to help people group with others who share their interests in activities

This app is meant to be a proof-of-concept to validate our problem-solution hypothesis. 
The hypothesis is that if individuals are able to join chat groups comprised of locals who share both their availability
and group activity interests, they will engage in conversation and organize events around that interest.

To run dev version: 
$yarn run dev-server
